# Daily Balance Lullaby
It´s a project for Money Makes Music challenge - creating music from money.

This code generates a peacefull lullaby melody by converting the transactions amount of an especific choosen date into piano notes.

So, after a really chaotic work day, you can transform a bunch of money-related numbers to help you fall asleep totally relaxed.

The project is made in Python running on Google Colab notebook.


How to run:

1-Run "General Setup"
(This cell install everything is needed to to run the code properly. In this step your CW´s credentials will be requested to give access to the database to run the query that will fetch de transactions data.) 



2-Run "Load Notes Table"



3-Run "Select the date interval from which your song will be generated:"
(Here you can select any date > '2019-06-01'. In this step a query will be executed and the transactions of the selected date will be converted to an coded string)



4-Run "Listen to your song and have a good night!"
(this section generates the melody by crossing the query´s encoded string and the notes table. Press the play button and enjoy your song!"
