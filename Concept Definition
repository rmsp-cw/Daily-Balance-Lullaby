Concept definition

A melody is born when a sequence of sounds happens along the timeline. For that, we need to have at least two basic parameters, one to define the sounds, and other to define the timeline.
A transaction is born when someone needs to pay for something.

That´s simple, Isn´t it? It´s true, but working with payments doesn´t always sound like music…
There´s a lot of information running wild through a huge complex system, a lot of problems to be fixed, a lot of processes to be designed, tons of numbers coming in and going out connecting millions of people.
It´s so fkn stressful! 
How could we transform this chaotic scenario into a peaceful music?
What about a clean and calm piano melody to make you sleep as a child?

So, let´s do it...

Parameters definition

A transaction file holds a bunch of information, both numerical - id, amount, fees, card number, installments, etc. - and non-numerical - cardholder name, merchant name, card brand,etc., so the first decision was to choose the most suitable parameters to be converted in musical notes.


The choice should satisfy some rules, it should allow random pick-up and also an easy codification methodology, so I´ve decided to work with the transaction amount column data because: 

-it happens randomly
-it has a wide range, allowing correlation with a large range of notes
-It´s numerical and allows easy manipulation
-It happens frequently along the time


First Manipulations

The transaction amount is a float number. To produce piano notes we need to covert it in integers.
